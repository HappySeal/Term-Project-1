IE206 Term Project 1 by ZBS &amp; CS

This project is a pandemic simulation for a grid-based environment. By moving the main elements, people in the population, with a random-walk principle based on uniform distribution, our simulation embraces the everyday movements of the people that can not be predicted. Also, by adjusting different parameters that could be a solution to the epidemic, such as vaccination or isolation, predicting the behavior of the virus could be possible.

Predicting the behavior of the virus enables decision-makers to develop and implement more efficient pandemic policies, which may be crucial for the well-being of the population during the pandemic. The aim of this project is to create environments for implementing different policies and comparing them in terms of results on the population.
